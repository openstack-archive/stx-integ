Subject: [PATCH] Add StarlingX specific restart command for Ceph monitors

Since we don't use systemd to manage Ceph and we have pmon monitoring we
have to make sure that:
1. Restarting is properly handled as "systemctl restart" will return error
   and manifest will fail;
2. Pmon does not check ceph-mon status during restart. Otherwise we risk
   getting into a race condition between the puppet restart and pmon
   detecting that ceph is down and trying a restart.

Both are resolved when using /etc/init.d/ceph-init-wrapper restart
