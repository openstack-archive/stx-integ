Subject: [PATCH 08/26] intel-iommu: allow ignoring Ethernet device RMRR with
 IOMMU passthrough

Some BIOS's are reporting DMAR RMRR entries for Ethernet devices
which is causing problems when PCI passthrough is enabled.  These
devices should be able to use the static identity map since the
host should not be enforcing specific address ranges when IOMMU
passthrough is enabled.

+RMRR for other devices?
+-----------------------
+
+There are reports of BIOS out there that indicate RMRR regions for things
+like ethernet devices.  As per mainline commit c875d2c1b8083 ("iommu/vt-d:
+ Exclude devices using RMRRs from IOMMU API domains") such a device is
+"fundamentally incompatible" with the IOMMU API and "we must prevent such
+devices from being used by the IOMMU API."  However, in the event that
+the RMRR indicated by the BIOS is assumed to be just a reporting error,
+there is an additional iommu boot arg that can be used to ignore RMRR
+settings for ethernet, i.e. "intel_iommu=on,eth_no_rmrr iommu=pt".
+Note that iommu=pt is required in order to eth_no_rmrr to have effect.
+
+If you use this setting, you should consult with your hardware vendor to
+confirm that it is just a reporting error, and that it truly is not
+actively using any DMA to/from RMRR, as otherwise system instability
+may result.
+
 How is IOVA generated?
