Subject: [PATCH 18/32] rcu: Don't wake rcuc/X kthreads on NOCB CPUs

[ upstream 630c7ed9ca0608912fa7c8591d05dfc8742dc9e6 in tip repo ]

Chris Friesen notice that rcuc/X kthreads were consuming CPU even on
NOCB CPUs.  This makes no sense because the only purpose or these
kthreads is to invoke normal (non-offloaded) callbacks, of which there
will never be any on NOCB CPUs.  This problem was due to a bug in
cpu_has_callbacks_ready_to_invoke(), which should have been checking
->nxttail[RCU_NEXT_TAIL] for NULL, but which was instead (incorrectly)
checking ->nxttail[RCU_DONE_TAIL].  Because ->nxttail[RCU_DONE_TAIL] is
never NULL, the only effect is to cause the rcuc/X kthread to execute
when it should not do so.

This commit therefore checks ->nxttail[RCU_NEXT_TAIL], which is NULL
for NOCB CPUs.
